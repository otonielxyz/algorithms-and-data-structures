# algorithms-and-data-structures
A collection of fundamental algorithm and data structure implementations written in Python.
This repository includes dynamic programming solutions (rod-cutting, knapsack), sorting algorithms (merge sort, quicksort), recursion examples, and performance comparisons.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a strong understanding of algorithmic problem-solving, time complexity, clean code structure, and unit testing.
